MODE A (Generate tasks) [iter=5]:
Read .opencode/workflow/00_PM_REQUEST.md and STRATEGY_KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md.
Also read .opencode/workflow/ISSUES.md and .opencode/workflow/DIALOGUE.md (latest state).
Load skills: strategy-knowledge-base, stage1-spec, orchestration-protocol.
If 00_PM_REQUEST.md starts with 'brainstorm:' or '/brainstorm', treat it as a brainstorm trigger:
- Extract the text after the prefix.
- Run: bash .opencode/workflow/brainstorm_chat.sh "<text>"
- In chat: output the command stdout only (no extra text).
Otherwise: write TASKS+COLLECT to .opencode/workflow/01_ARCH_TASKS.md.
In chat: ACK only.
